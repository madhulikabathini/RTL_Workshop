## Introduction

Physical design is a critical stage in the VLSI flow where a synthesized netlist is converted into a manufacturable silicon layout.

This module explores the SKY130 + OpenLane physical design flow, focusing on:
- Global and detailed routing
- Maze routing (Lee's Algorithm)
- DRC, wire-width, and via-spacing checks
- Parasitic extraction and SPEF generation
- Detailed routing with TritonRoute

Practical work also includes route-guide preprocessing, intra-layer parallel routing, inter-layer sequential routing, connectivity handling, topology optimization, and inspection of OpenLane's generated synthesis/routing results.

**Goal:** Understand how routing satisfies design rules, maintains connectivity, and prepares a design for post-layout timing analysis and physical verification.

---

## 1. Routing

Routing connects placed standard cells, pins, and other components through metal layers while satisfying design rules.

Main stages:
- Global routing
- Fast routing
- Detailed routing
- Design-rule-aware routing
- Connectivity verification

### 1.1 Route

Connects input/output pins across metal layers using buffers, flip-flops, and routing tracks.

> Routed design showing nets connecting input pins (`Din1–Din4`, `CLK1`, `CLK2`) to output pins. Includes flip-flops, buffers, decap cells, standard cells, metal interconnects, and clock/data paths.

---

## 2. Maze Routing – Lee's Algorithm

A grid-based technique for finding a valid path between two points while avoiding obstacles.

**Algorithm steps:**
1. Start from the source point
2. Expand the routing grid
3. Assign distance values to reachable cells
4. Continue until destination is reached
5. Backtrack along the minimum-distance path

> Grid explored and labeled by distance from source. Guarantees shortest valid path when one exists, though memory-intensive for large grids.

---

## 3. Design Rule Checking

DRC verifies that a layout satisfies fabrication rules for the chosen technology.

**Typical rules:**
- Minimum wire width
- Minimum spacing
- Via spacing
- Metal enclosure
- Layer-specific restrictions
- Connectivity constraints

### 3.1 DRC Clean Layout

> Routed design after DRC verification — a "clean" result means all checked rules are satisfied.

---

## 4. DRC – Wire Width

Wires narrower than the minimum allowed width can violate manufacturing rules and reduce interconnect reliability.

> Illustrates the minimum-width constraint applied during verification.

---

## 5. DRC – Via Spacing

Correct spacing between vias and surrounding structures prevents manufacturing violations and unintended shorts.

> Shows adequate spacing maintained between vias and nearby structures.

---

## 6. Parasitic Extraction

After routing, parasitic elements from physical interconnects must be extracted:
- Resistance
- Capacitance
- Interconnect delay
- Coupling effects

Used later for accurate post-layout timing analysis.
